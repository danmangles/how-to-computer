# ðŸ—¡ðŸªšâš™ Sharp Tools Checklist ðŸ—¡ðŸªšâš™

Make a copy of this file, add it to a ticket/ to-do, and check it off when you think it's complete

- [ ] Get your `ssh` keys setup. This means: ONE `.ssh/config` file on your computer,
and make sure it's got `ForwardAgent Yes` at the top under `Host *`. Should NOT require a
password to use, must be connected to your Github profile
- [ ] Get one (or three) good LLMs setup. Ideally get Github Copilot, and IDEALLY IDEALLY get the copilot
code review firing. You may need to request access
- [ ] VSCode needs to open to the right folder every time, with the right kind of terminal (WSL/Powershell, etc)
opening. Check my other blog on how to set up a terminal nicely. Get all the extensions recommended for
that particular language/environment you're using.
- [ ] Terminal search is super powerful. On Linux/WSL/Powershell - this is a `Ctrl+R` to find stuff. Learn to love this tool
and make sure autocomplete is working (see other article). Get a few good aliases set up.
- [ ] Make sure your Chrome bookmarks, especially for Github (PRs, Milestones, task trackers, key design docs) are nicely organised
- [ ] Get familiar with some key git commands, including how to create a new branch, check out a branch, push work.
- [ ] You have read our LLM usage guidelines (incoming)

Happy coding ðŸ˜Ž
